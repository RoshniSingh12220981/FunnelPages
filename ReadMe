##Funnel Pages Collection – Internship Project

##This repository contains a collection of funnel pages designed and developed as part of my internship work. These pages are built to guide users through a step-by-step journey, optimizing user engagement and conversion. Each page is structured to serve a specific purpose in the sales or lead generation funnel.
